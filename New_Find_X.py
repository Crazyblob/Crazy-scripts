#issues before I come back,
#ScanforOperator == OperatorSigns: only scans
#the whole thing. We need to make it so it checks each
#individual operator within the string, / and if statement
#where if it contains a character within the string it passes.
#Thinking about making a repeated loop where it == OperatorSigns[range]

#A way to specifically find each operator in the list, similar to the brute, is to check each letter in the
#inputted equation for the first position of the operator string, then another check for each position.
